# hangman_game

This is standard version of hangman game. The game runs in this order:
1- First we define how will the losing stages be shown to user. 
2- We create a word list from the file 'english_words.txt'
3- Later we define 2 helpful functions, one is for generating a new word and the other is for setting the variables
each time a new game begins. 
4- The rest is the main function that runs the game. Each time a user guesses a correct letter, we display them and 
rest of the letters is shown by '_'.
5- The goal is to guess the word before you run out of 6 attempts. (6th error finishes the game)
6- After each game you're asked to play again and also trackes number of games you win or lose. In the end when you no 
longer want to play, the game will display your win/ total games stats.
